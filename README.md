The R code has been developed with reference to [R for Data Science (2e)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), and the official documentation of [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), and [**DataBrewer.co**](https://www.databrewer.co/). See breakdown of modules below:

- Data visualization with ggplot2 ([tutorial](https://www.databrewer.co/R/visualization/introduction) of the fundamentals; and [data viz. gallery](https://www.databrewer.co/R/gallery)).

- [Data wrangling](https://www.databrewer.co/R/data-wrangling) with the following packages:
- [tidyr](https://www.databrewer.co/R/data-wrangling/tidyr/introduction): transform (e.g., pivoting) the dataset into tidy structure.
- [dplyr](https://www.databrewer.co/R/data-wrangling/dplyr/0-introduction): a basic tool to work with data frames.     
- [stringr](https://www.databrewer.co/R/data-wrangling/stringr/0-introduction): work with strings. 
- [regular expression](https://www.databrewer.co/R/data-wrangling/regular-expression/0-introduction): search and match a string pattern.
- [purrr](https://www.databrewer.co/R/data-wrangling/purrr/introduction): functional programming (e.g., iterating functions across elements of columns).
- [tibble](https://www.databrewer.co/R/data-wrangling/tibble/introduction): work with data frames in the modern tibble structure.
